**Exploring use of Ontologies with the Ethereum Blockchain**

**Issues**

_Missing Attributes_

These attributes are in the chain data export but were not found in the model:

block_total_difficulty 
block_transaction_count
block_miner


_Blank Nodes_

I was thinking of using blank nodes for the instances of blocks but chose to define a uri pattern with
the block number placed at the fragements/named anchor .
